    "### 1. Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Begin with a brief, bullet-point summary of your most novel and non-trivial findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Narrative-Driven Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use clear **section headers** (`#`, `##`, `###`) to guide the reader.\n",
    "* Present your EDA as a story — explain your approach, decisions, and discoveries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the official [data retrieval script]() to load your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. General Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provide a high-level summary of the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Data integrity checks\n",
    "  * Data types, value ranges, and completeness\n",
    "  * Basic descriptive statistics and exploratory plots\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Focused Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deep dive into features or feature groups you find interesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Justify your selection\n",
    "  * Provide statistical and visual analysis\n",
    "  * Summarize findings\n",
    "\n",
    "> Your exploration should lead to one of two conclusions:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * ✅ \"There appears to be signal worth modeling\" **(preferred)**\n",
    "> * ❌ \"No signal found here (but still informative)\" \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Showcase Your Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is your chance to shine.\n",
    "  Highlight your unique thinking through:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Rigorous statistical analysis\n",
    "  * Creative visualizations\n",

    "\n",
    "* Use strong titles and captions to enhance the reader’s understanding.\n",
    "* Prioritize clarity and insight over code quantity.\n",
    "* Write with the assumption that your audience has **5 minutes** to review your work.\n",
    "* Link out to deeper analyses pushed as separate notebooks on GitHub** to avoid cluttering the main notebook:\n",
