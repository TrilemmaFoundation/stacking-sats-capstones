    "\n",
    "> 🧠 Think of this notebook as a **take-home assignment** for a research role at a fund.  \n",
    "> Reviewers will assess both your **modeling skill** and your ability to **communicate clearly**.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Submit a **Python notebook** named `btc_accumulation_model.ipynb`\n",
    "- Save it in a folder called `deliverables` at the root of your GitHub repo\n",
    "- Title the notebook (first markdown cell) to reflect your strategy  \n",
    "  *Example: `Optimal Bitcoin Accumulation via a 200-day MA Model`*\n",
    "- Push to your **GitHub repo** by the deadline\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summarize your **modeling approach**\n",
    "- Highlight key **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) insights** that led to your strategy\n",
    "- Discuss the strengths and limitations of your model referencing its `Final Model Score` (derived from model_development_template.ipynb) \n",
    "- Use **quantitative evidence** to support claims (e.g., “Our model beat uniform DCA in 61% of windows”)\n",
    "- Keep it concise and understandable without deep technical detail\n",

    "---\n",

    "### 2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "* Showcase the key **EDA insights** that directly shaped your model\n",
    "* This section should be **visual**. We want to **see** your analysis, not just read about it\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use **plots**, **charts**, and **figures** to make your insights tangible\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the template notebook\n",
    "2. Define your features inside `construct_features()` under `✍️ User Code`\n",
    "3. Write your model logic inside `compute_weights()` under `✍️ User Code`\n",
    "4. Run all cells top-to-bottom\n",
    "5. You must see this at the end:  \n",
    "   ```✅ Strategy is ready for submission.```\n",
    "6. You may keep your repository private during the tournament to protect your work, but you must make it public immediately after the final submission deadline to be eligible for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Model Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Your model must:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **only past and current data** (no forward-looking features)\n",
    "- Output weights that:\n",
    "  - Are all **positive**\n",
    "  - Are all **≥ MIN_WEIGHT**\n",
    "  - **Sum to 1** in each window\n",
    "- **Outperform or match** uniform DCA in **at least 50%** of rolling windows\n",
    "- **Not modify boilerplate code**\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ Modifying any of the boilerplate code (e.g., helper functions, evaluation logic) will result in disqualification.  \n",
    "> You may ignore parts of the boilerplate that don't generalize to your feature set (e.g., plotting logic).\n",

    "## 🚀 Success Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧠 Your notebook should have a **30-second takeaway**: readers should quickly grasp the core idea\n",
    "- 🔬 It should also support **deep dives**: link your EDA and development notebooks for those wanting details\n",
    "- ✨ Prioritize **visual polish**: clean plots, labeled axes, well-formatted markdown, and consistent layout\n",
